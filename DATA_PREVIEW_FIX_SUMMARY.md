# Data Preview Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The data preview in the frontend was showing empty even though files were uploading successfully and the backend was connected.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. ✅ Fixed: Field Name Mismatch in Preview Data
**Problem**: Backend was sending `preview_data.sample_rows` but frontend expected `preview_data.rows`

**Backend Fix** (`backend/app/api/routes/upload.py`):
```python
# Before
"preview_data": {
    "columns": basic_info.get("columns", []),
    "sample_rows": basic_info.get("preview_rows_data", [])
}

# After  
"preview_data": {
    "columns": basic_info.get("columns", []),
    "rows": basic_info.get("preview_rows_data", [])
}
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed: Row/Column Count Path Issue
**Problem**: Frontend was looking for row/column counts in `uploadResult.file_info.rows` but backend sends them at `uploadResult.rows`

**Frontend Fix** (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`):
```typescript
// Before
rows: uploadResult.file_info?.rows || 0,
columns: uploadResult.file_info?.columns || 0

// After
rows: uploadResult.rows || 0,
columns: uploadResult.columns || 0
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes, when uploading a real file:

1. ✅ Backend processes file and returns correct preview data structure
2. ✅ Frontend receives and displays actual data rows in the preview table  
3. ✅ Data preview shows real column names and data values
4. ✅ Row/column counts display correctly (e.g., "5 rows × 4 columns")
5. ✅ "LIVE DATA" badge appears instead of "DEMO DATA"

## API Response Format (Fixed)

Upload endpoint now returns:
```json
{
    "message": "File uploaded successfully",
    "file_id": "uuid-string",
    "filename": "data.csv",
    "rows": 5,
    "columns": 4,
    "preview_data": {
        "columns": ["Name", "Age", "Department", "Salary"],
        "rows": [
            {"Name": "John Doe", "Age": 30, "Department": "Engineering", "Salary": 75000},
            {"Name": "Jane Smith", "Age": 28, "Department": "Marketing", "Salary": 65000}
        ]
    }
}
```

The data preview should now properly display the uploaded file content!
