- **Solution**: Modified logging filter to reduce noise

### Next Action:
- Respect running services (RULE 4)
- Test React Query integration with live running backend
- Continue with next task in sequence

### Rule Compliance:
- ✅ RULE 1: Use PowerShell syntax (`;` not `&&`)
- ✅ RULE 2: Sequential command execution
- ✅ RULE 3: Single terminal usage
- ✅ RULE 4: Respect running services - DO NOT RESTART
- ✅ RULE 5: Structured logging created

## 2025-06-29 17:15:00 - UI Troubleshooting and Fixes
### Issue Identified:
- User reported "garbage looking upload page UI" despite frontend running on port 3000
- Multiple TypeScript compilation errors were preventing proper UI rendering
- Missing Lucide React icons and import path issues affecting component functionality

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Fixed import paths in visualization page (DataStatisticsDashboard, InteractiveCharts)
- ✅ Replaced missing Lucide React icons:
  - Removed 'Scatter' icon usage, replaced with 'BarChart'
  - Replaced 'Memory' icon with 'HardDrive' in agent health monitor

- Progressive error fixing allows for incremental improvements while maintaining working state

### Next Steps:
- Continue fixing remaining UI component TypeScript errors
- Test the improved UI rendering in browser
- Address any remaining styling or functionality issues
- Complete integration of all accessibility components into main application

### Status:
- Frontend remains operational on port 3000
- Core UI components now have fewer blocking errors
- Application should display improved glassmorphism interface
- Progressive enhancement approach working effectively
