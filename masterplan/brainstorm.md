# DEEP BRAINSTORM - PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
# Enterprise Insights Copilot - Fresh Start Analysis

## LESSONS LEARNED FROM OLDVERSION

### WHAT WENT WRONG
1. **Complex Agent Orchestration**: Too many agents, unclear workflow
2. **Session Management**: Inconsistent state tracking across components
3. **Frontend/Backend Coupling**: Tight coupling caused integration issues
4. **Error Propagation**: Errors cascaded through the system
5. **Testing Gaps**: Missing integration tests led to hidden bugs
6. **Configuration Complexity**: Too many configuration dependencies

### WHAT WORKED WELL
1. **FastAPI Structure**: Clean API endpoint organization
2. **Next.js Frontend**: Good component structure
3. **File Upload Logic**: Core upload functionality was solid
4. **Agent Base Classes**: Good abstraction pattern
5. **Environment Setup**: Docker and development setup

## NEW ARCHITECTURE APPROACH

### PHASE 1: CORE FOUNDATION (Week 1)
**Minimal Viable System**
- Simple FastAPI backend with health check
- Basic file upload endpoint
- Simple data preview
- No agents yet - just direct processing
- Basic Next.js frontend with upload UI

**Success Criteria:**
- Upload CSV file ✓
- Display file info ✓
- Show data preview ✓
- Health monitoring ✓

### PHASE 2: SINGLE AGENT (Week 2)
**Add One Agent at a Time**
- Data Analysis Agent only
- Simple query processing
- Basic insights generation
- No complex orchestration

**Success Criteria:**
- Process uploaded data ✓
- Generate basic insights ✓
- Display results in UI ✓
- Error handling works ✓

### PHASE 3: AGENT ORCHESTRATION (Week 3)
**Add Orchestration Layer**
- Planning Agent
- Query Agent
- Simple workflow: Plan → Query → Data → Insights
- Clear state management

**Success Criteria:**
- Multi-agent workflow ✓
- Proper error propagation ✓
- Session tracking ✓
- Performance monitoring ✓

### PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES (Week 4+)
**Additional Capabilities**
- Vector database integration
- Chart generation
- Advanced analytics
- Real-time updates

## SIMPLIFIED AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### CORE AGENTS (Keep It Simple)
1. **Planning Agent**: Analyzes query intent
2. **Data Agent**: File processing and analysis
3. **Query Agent**: Natural language to structured queries
4. **Insight Agent**: Generate business insights

### REMOVED COMPLEXITY
- No Critique Agent (build quality in, don't check after)
- No Debate Agent (too complex for MVP)
- No Narrative Agent (combine with Insight Agent)
- No Chart Agent initially (add in Phase 4)

## TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISIONS

### BACKEND
- **FastAPI**: Proven choice, keep it
- **SQLite**: Start simple, can upgrade later
- **Pandas**: For data processing
- **Pydantic**: For data validation
- **Python 3.11+**: Latest stable

### FRONTEND
- **Next.js 14**: App router, server components
- **TypeScript**: Type safety from day one
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling
- **React Query**: For API state management
- **Zod**: Frontend validation

### INFRASTRUCTURE
- **Docker**: Development consistency
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration
- **Logging**: Structured logging from start
- **Health Checks**: Built into every service

## API DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### REST CONVENTIONS
- GET /health (system health)
- POST /upload (file upload)
- GET /files/{id} (file info)
- POST /query (process query)
- GET /query/{id}/status (query status)

### RESPONSE STANDARDS
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {...},
  "error": null,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-27T...",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### ERROR STANDARDS
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "User-friendly message",
    "details": {...}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-27T...",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### DAILY PROCESS
1. Start with failing test
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Test manually
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit working state
6. Document changes

### MILESTONE GATES
- Each phase requires full testing
- Performance benchmarks must pass
- Documentation must be updated
- Demo must work end-to-end

## RISK MITIGATION

### IDENTIFIED RISKS
1. **Agent Complexity**: Mitigate with simple, single-purpose agents
2. **State Management**: Use clear session patterns
3. **Error Handling**: Implement circuit breakers
4. **Performance**: Monitor from day one
5. **Dependencies**: Lock versions, minimize count

### BACKUP PLANS
- If agents fail: Fall back to direct processing
- If real-time fails: Use polling patterns
- If complex queries fail: Provide simple alternatives
- If performance issues: Implement caching

## SUCCESS DEFINITION

### PHASE 1 SUCCESS
- User uploads CSV
- Sees file contents
- System is stable
- Response times < 2 seconds

### PHASE 2 SUCCESS
- User asks "What's in this data?"
- Gets meaningful insights
- Process takes < 30 seconds
- No crashes or errors

### PHASE 3 SUCCESS
- Multi-step queries work
- Real-time status updates
- Handles concurrent users
- Error recovery works

### FINAL SUCCESS
- Production-ready system
- Handles 10MB files easily
- Supports 10 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime
- Clear monitoring and logging
