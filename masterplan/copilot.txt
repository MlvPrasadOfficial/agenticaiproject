# 7 RULES FOR COPILOT OPERATIONS

## RULE 1: PowerShell Commands
Always use `;` instead of `&&` in commands as they are running in PowerShell.

## RULE 2: Sequential Command Execution  
Always run one command at a time, see output of it in terminal and proceed further.

## RULE 3: Single Terminal Usage
Always run all commands in the same terminal, don't open more than 1 terminal.

## RULE 4: Respect Running Services
The frontend and backend are always running in PowerShell terminals. Check output of terminal, don't try to rerun them or kill, just wait for 5 seconds.

## RULE 5: Structured Logging
Always create logs under logs folder with timestamp and test name.

## RULE 6: Terminal Output Analysis
Read the Copilot PowerShell terminal output before running any command.

## RULE 7: Changes and Learning Documentation
Add changes/learning/findings after every end of request in changes.txt with date and timestamp, followed by the changes/findings/learning in concise format. New entries go below previous ones with timestamps for historical tracking.

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Frontend Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Framework**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Environment Variables**: Configure in Vercel dashboard

### Backend Deployment
- **Platform**: Render
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Environment Variables**: Configure in Render dashboard

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions with GitHub Copilot integration
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, pull requests
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every commit
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy on successful tests

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Local Development
- Frontend: `npm run dev` (runs on localhost:3000)
- Backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` (runs on localhost:8000)
- No Docker containers - native development environment

### Version Control
- GitHub repository with Copilot integration
- Feature branches for new development
- Pull request reviews with Copilot assistance
- Automated code analysis and suggestions
