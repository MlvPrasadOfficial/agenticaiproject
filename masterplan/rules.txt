# PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RULES
# Enterprise Insights Copilot - Multi-Agent AI System
# Created: June 27, 2025

## THE 7 FUNDAMENTAL RULES

### RULE 1: SIMPLICITY FIRST
- Start with the simplest working version
- Add complexity incrementally
- Each feature must work before adding the next
- Avoid over-engineering from the start

### RULE 2: CLEAR SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
- Backend: Pure API logic, no frontend dependencies
- Frontend: Pure UI logic, no backend dependencies  
- Agents: Single responsibility, well-defined interfaces
- Database/Storage: Isolated data layer

### RULE 3: CONSISTENT ERROR HANDLING
- Every API endpoint must have proper error handling
- Every agent must handle failures gracefully
- Every frontend component must handle loading/error states
- Log errors consistently with clear context

### RULE 4: INCREMENTAL TESTING
- Test each component as it's built
- Integration tests before moving to next feature
- Manual testing at every milestone
- Automated tests for critical paths

### RULE 5: DOCUMENTATION AS CODE
- Document decisions as we make them
- Keep API contracts up to date
- Maintain clear README files
- Comment complex logic inline

### RULE 6: VERSION CONTROL DISCIPLINE
- Commit working states frequently
- Tag major milestones
- Keep feature branches focused
- Never commit broken code

### RULE 7: PERFORMANCE AWARENESS
- Monitor response times from day one
- Optimize database queries early
- Handle large file uploads properly
- Plan for concurrent users

## ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES

### DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
- Lock dependency versions
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Regular security updates
- Clear dependency documentation

### ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENCY
- Docker for consistent environments
- Environment variables for configuration
- Clear setup instructions
- Local development mirrors production

### USER EXPERIENCE FOCUS
- Fast load times
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive navigation
- Mobile-responsive design

### SECURITY BY DESIGN
- Input validation everywhere
- Secure file uploads
- API authentication
- Data encryption at rest

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Backend health check: < 100ms response
- File upload: < 5 seconds for 10MB
- Query processing: < 30 seconds end-to-end
- Frontend load: < 2 seconds first paint
- Zero crashes in normal operation
