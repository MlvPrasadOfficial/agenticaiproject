**Project Title:** Enterprise Insights Copilot (Rebuild Version)

**Project Description:**

We are rebuilding the entire "Enterprise Insights Copilot" project from scratch based on the original version hosted at: [https://github.com/MlvPrasadOfficial/enterprise-insights-copilot](https://github.com/MlvPrasadOfficial/enterprise-insights-copilot). The aim is to create a highly sophisticated, production-ready, full-stack GenAI-powered Business Intelligence assistant capable of handling complex enterprise data, generating actionable insights, producing visualizations, narratives, and end-to-end business reports using cutting-edge AI agents and orchestration frameworks.

**Full Build Map:**

**Phase 1: Initial Setup**

* Create monorepo structure (frontend + backend).
* Backend scaffold with FastAPI (async ready).
* Frontend scaffold with Next.js (SSR ready) + TailwindCSS dark theme with glassmorphism.
* Environment setup for local Ollama LLaMA 3.1 serving.
* Pinecone vector store account and API keys configured.

**Phase 2: File Upload & Data Ingestion Module**

* Upload API with schema validation.
* Auto column-type inference (categorical, numerical, date).
* Generate column profile summary.
* Store file metadata in database.
* Trigger Data Agent and Cleaner Agent immediately after successful upload.

**Phase 3: Core LLM & RAG Setup**

* Integrate Ollama LLaMA 3.1 model locally.
* Embed uploaded data using embedding models.
* Store embeddings into Pinecone.
* Validate retrieval quality for dataset-grounded queries.

**Phase 4: Multi-Agent Framework Design**

* Build Planning Agent (central orchestrator): Analyzes user query, orchestrates downstream agents based on query type.
* Build Query Agent: Parses and understands user intent.
* Build Retrieval Agent: Fetches relevant data context from Pinecone.
* Build Data Agent: Performs exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, column profiling.
* Build Cleaner Agent: Handles missing values, standardizes units, detects outliers.
* Build SQL Agent: Generates SQL queries dynamically for structured analysis.
* Build Insight Agent: Performs advanced statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, trend forecasting, and anomaly detection.
* Build Chart Agent: Generates chart specifications for visualizations (bar, line, area, scatter, dashboards).
* Build Critique Agent: Reviews agent outputs for logical consistency and detects potential reasoning gaps.
* Build Debate Agent: Simulates multiple reasoning paths to resolve conflicting interpretations.
* Build Narrative Agent: Crafts human-like narratives and contextual business stories.
* Build Report Generator Agent: Compiles narrative, insights, charts into full professional reports.

**Phase 5: Orchestration Layer (LangGraph + LangChain)**

* Build LangGraph node-based agent orchestration.
* Define control flow for each agent based on trigger events.
* Full streaming capability via LangChain Runnable interface.
* Complete LangSmith integration for tracing, debugging, and evaluation.

**Phase 6: Frontend Feature Build**

* File Upload Interface with progress tracking.
* Query Box (chat-like interface with streaming answers).
* Insight Bubble rendering with highlight summaries.
* Visualization Dashboard with dynamic charts.
* Full Report download panel.
* Backend Agent Flow visualizer (for debug/tracing view).

**Phase 7: Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline**

* Backend deployment to Render (no Docker).
* Frontend deployment to Vercel.
* GitHub Actions setup for CI/CD with automated tests.
* Secrets management for secure API key usage.

**Phase 8: Testing & Stress Validation**

* Pytest coverage for all agents.
* Synthetic stress dataset generation for testing outlier, missing value, inconsistent data formats.
* Edge case evaluations to ensure agent robustness.

**Phase 9: Monitoring, Logging & Observability**

* Centralized logging for agent decisions.
* Retry logic for LLM failures.
* LangSmith session storage for historical traces.

**Phase 10: Future Scope Extension Modules**

* Multi-tenant SaaS structure.
* RBAC user authentication.
* External data warehouse integrations.
* Domain-specific fine-tuning for specialized industries.
* API integrations (Snowflake, Salesforce, etc.).
* Mobile responsive redesign.
